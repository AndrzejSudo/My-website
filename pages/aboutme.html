<article>I'm currently working for GE Steam Power as a design engineer for generator safety&governance/auxiliary systems on nuclear power plants. I was responsible for preparation of design documentation, performing on-site assessment of running systems, technical discussions with customers/subsuppliers/manufacturers from all around the world. Among others I was also designated to technical leading and supervision of the projects for new installments and service works, creating mechanical stress calculation reports, preparation of technical quotations for obsolete equipements. However after 4 years I realized that this field has not that much to offer in terms of knowledge and soon this market itself is going to be monopolized.</article>
<article>In contrast, IT is much more progressive and spread across many fields and maintaining digital safety has its share in each one of them. That's why I'm trying to switch my proficiency and pursue cybersecurity career.</article>
